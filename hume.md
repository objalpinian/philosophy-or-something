Hume's guillotine is treated as this decisive barrier between facts and values despite Hume explicitly denying that because subjectivists are massive fucking retards. Properly understood, Hume's point is that a purely descriptive set a premises cannot yield a normative conclusion without at least one normative premise. This is true in and of itself, but is philosophically irrelevant, because normativity is a precondition of both reasoning and action. Consequently, the fact–value dichotomy cannot be as absolute. The idea that we start with a purely descriptive base and then derive normativity later is a category error, as there exists no standpoint of inquiry prior to normativity.

Choosing X over Y is to treat X as what ought to be done. These values are not arbitrary, any act of cognition presupposes a choice for existence over non-existence. To deny that existence is valued is still to engage in action, which presupposes continuation. This valuation is not chosen because it is implicit in action itself. One can reject it only by ceasing to act altogether, which must be carried out through action and thus presuppose the very condition they reject. The denial therefore relies on the very condition it attempts to negate, so it is performatively self-defeating.

Some subjectivists object that the injunction to choose life is itself an arbitrary starting point, or that hypothetical imperatives cannot ground genuine normativity. This is a category error. Continued agency is not a value posited at the start of deliberation, it is a condition presupposed by any act of deliberation whatsoever. Norms governing action are therefore conditional insofar that they apply to agents, but they are not optional or arbitrary. A category "ought" detached from the nature and conditions of agency is incoherent. The most basic normativity is implicit in choosing as such.
