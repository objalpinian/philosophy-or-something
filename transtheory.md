Taking the name "trans identity" literally, it would imply that self identification is constitutive of an agent's identity. Properly understood, identity is logically prior to action. For any subject X to self-identify, X must exist prior to that act. But on the assumption, X does not yet exist as the thing self-identification alledly creates. Therefore, X must exist in order not yet to exist.

Gender can be conceptually defined in a variety of sociological ways independently of sex, all of which fail.

Self-identity is a theory of gender in which an individual's declaration of identity is the sole criterion for classification. Here, "being a woman" or "being a man" is det ermined exclusively by the person's self-avowed identification, regardless of anything else. The problem we run into with this definition is that, if gender is purely self-declared, the definition becomes tautological: "A woman ais anyone who says they are a woman." This renders gender completely meaningless as a sociological category.

Using social roles or stereotypes defines categories based on culturally or historically prescribed behaviors or social functions associated with men and women. This classification relies on collective patterns of behavior rather than individual self-declaration. But defining gender by social roles presupposes existing categories; it is circular. Roles historically correlated with sex cannot define categories that are themselves presumed by these roles.

External perception is a conception of gender in which classification depends on how others perceive an individual. Under this, gender is relational, defined by the individual and society. But if gender is determined by how others perceive one, self-assignment is logically insufficient., The individual cannot unilaterally instantiate the category. 

Gender, if it is to function as a meaningful social category, must be grounded in objective, observable criteria. The only coherent basis is biological sex, because alternative definitions all lead to incoherence.
