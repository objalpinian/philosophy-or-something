Taking the name "trans identity" literally, it would imply that self identification is constitutive of an agent's identity. Properly understood, identity is logically prior to action. If identity were constituted by action, then there would be no subject to perform, nor would their be a bearer of repetition. For any subject X to self-identify, X must exist prior to that act. But on the assumption, X does not yet exist as the thing self-identification alledly creates. Therefore, X must exist in order not yet to exist.

But gender can be conceptually defined in a variety of sociological ways independently of sex, all of which fail.

Self-identity is a theory of gender in which an individual's declaration of identity is the sole criterion for classification. Here, "being a woman" or "being a man" is determined exclusively by the person's self-avowed identification, regardless of anything else. The problem we run into with this definition is that, if gender is purely self-declared, the definition becomes tautological: "A woman is anyone who says they are a woman." This renders gender completely meaningless as a sociological category.

Using social roles or stereotypes defines categories based on culturally or historically prescribed behaviors or social functions associated with men and women. This classification relies on collective patterns of behavior rather than individual self-declaration. But defining gender by social roles presupposes existing categories; it is circular. Roles historically correlated with sex cannot define categories that are themselves presumed by these roles.

External perception is a conception of gender in which classification depends on how others perceive an individual. Under this, gender is relational, defined by the individual and society. But if gender is determined by how others perceive one, self-assignment is logically insufficient., The individual cannot unilaterally instantiate the category. Trans theory will have to concede that either self identification can't act as a criterion or that gender isn't socially constructed. You cannot consistently maintain that gender is socially constructed while also treating self-identification as a decisive or authoritative criterion of gender category membership. 

"Gender is a socially constituted, historically sex-linked, norm-governed status-category in which self-identification may be necessary for claims but never sufficient for authoritative classification, and recognition requires independent social justification."

This definition has recently gained traction, usually presented as a conciliatory or "bulletproof" account of gender. In fact, it requires conceding most of what contemporary trans theory aims to establish. The definition explicitly denies that self-identification is sufficient for gender category membership, thereby abandoning the claim that self-ascription can ground it.

Contemporary trans theory requires a bridge from self-identification to authoritative classification. Formally, from S(X,G) to G(X) to obligations on others. The proposed definition denies the existence of such a bridge. It therefore avoids the problem only by relinquishing the central theoretical commitment that self-identification has decisive normative force.

More seriously, the definition is seriously unstable. It equivocates between multiple semantic roles that cannot coherently be unified under a single predicate.

"Historically sex linked" describes a tracking relation (gender as a classificatory scheme correlated with sex)

"Norm-governed" describes a regulative framework (gender as a set of expectations)

"Status-category" describes a position within an institution or practice

"Self-identification may be necessary for claims" treats gender as something like a first person indexical

"Authoritative classification" treats gender as a third person public predicate

These are not coextensive semantic functions. A term cannot simultaneously function as a descriptive classifier, normative role, subjective avowal, and an institutional status without equivocation. The word "gender" here literally shifts meaning mid definition.

The claim "self-identification may be necessary for claims" is especially misleading. What is self-identification necessary for? If gender is a status category, then semantic competence requires G(X) has conditions independent of X's beliefs. But the clause "self-identification may be necessary for claims" conflates the act of making a claim with the truth conditions of the predicate "X is G." Self identification is trivially necessary to assert anything about oneself, sure, but that is just a pragmatic fact about speech acts, not any semantic condition of category membership. The clause therefore adds no substantive content, yet falsely suggests relevance. 

"Recognition requires independent social justification" contradicts the idea that gender is a status-category. If gender really is a status-category, then recognition follows constitutive rules and role criteria. Discretionary "justification" implies that recognition is discretionary or case by case. This makes "gender" a normative verdict. That turns "X is a woman" from a classificatory statement into an endorsement or refusal. Which means the predicate no longer denotes a category at all, as it only denotes approval. 

Judith Butler's dogshit philosophy in no way refutes this. All it does is redefine identity into a meaningless performative brute. Seriously, who let this self righteous BITCH into modern philosophy? STOP TRYING TO BRING HER INTO ARGUMENTS, HER PHILOSOPHY IS SHIT. SHE ISN'T WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

From the fact that gender roles vary historically, she illegitimately concludes that sex categories lack ontological grounding. Social mediation is not the social construction of the underlying referent. Language shaping interpretation in no way creates reality.

If there is no prior subject, then who performs? Who repeats? Who experiences constraint? Performativity presupposes an agent with continuity capable of acting over time.
